# EXTREME TV

EXTREME TV is an Android media hub for TV, phone, and tablet form factors. This repository is maintained as a source-code and development mirror for the Android application.

The app provides a media browser, player shell, profile support, optional cloud sync, IPTV playlist support, catalog configuration, home-server integrations, and integrations with user-configured sources. EXTREME TV does not host, store, sell, or distribute movies, series, live TV channels, playlists, streams, or other third-party media.

## Support EXTREME TV

EXTREME TV is a free hobby project built and maintained with a lot of time, testing, hosting, and service costs. The goal is to keep EXTREME TV free as it grows, but running and improving it still costs money every month.

If EXTREME TV helps you and you want to support development, donations are appreciated:

## Content And Source Policy

EXTREME TV is a media browser and player interface for user-configured sources. It works like a media player or browser: users provide their own services, playlists, addons, and URLs.

This repository does not include hosted media content, bundled playlists, IPTV credentials, debrid accounts, third-party streaming catalogs, or links intended to enable unauthorized access to content. No movies, series, live TV channels, playlists, or other third-party media are hosted by this repository or by EXTREME TV.

Users are solely responsible for their usage and must comply with applicable local laws. If you believe content accessed through an external source violates copyright law, contact the actual file host, service provider, or source maintainer. The EXTREME TV repository and developers cannot remove content hosted by third parties.

Contributors should not submit copyrighted media, credentials, private keys, access tokens, or links intended to enable unauthorized access to content.

## Cloud Sync

EXTREME TV Cloud is optional. When enabled, it can sync profiles, settings, catalogs, IPTV state, watch progress, watchlist state, and profile avatars across devices. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details and account deletion instructions.

## Build And Run

Requirements:

- Android Studio or Android SDK command-line tools
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35

Use the tracked Gradle wrapper:

bash
./gradlew :app:assemblePlayDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleSideloadDebug

On Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt:

powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assemblePlayDebug
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleSideloadDebug

APK builds include 32-bit and 64-bit ARM by default. For an x86/x86_64 emulator,
add `-PincludeX86Abis=true` to the Gradle command.

Install a debug build on a connected Android TV, Fire TV, emulator, phone, or tablet:

bash
./gradlew :app:installPlayDebug
./gradlew :app:installSideloadDebug

For network ADB devices:

bash
adb connect <device-ip>:5555
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/sideload/debug/app-sideload-debug.apk

Build variants:

- `play`: Play Store build, self-update disabled.
- `sideload`: Direct APK build, self-update enabled.
- `debug`: development build.
- `staging`: release-like build signed with the debug keystore for upgrade testing.
- `release`: production build. Use a private release keystore for distribution.

## Local Configuration

Cloud sync, Google sign-in, and Supabase-backed auth require local secrets. Copy the defaults file and fill in real values:

bash
cp secrets.defaults.properties secrets.properties

`secrets.properties` is ignored and must not be committed.

Discord Rich Presence is optional and requires Discord's separately licensed
Android Partner SDK. Place the approved file at
`app/libs/discord_partner_sdk.aar` and set `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` in
`secrets.properties`. Builds without that AAR remain valid, but show Discord as
unavailable instead of compiling a simulated connection. Do not commit or
redistribute the AAR unless your Discord SDK agreement explicitly permits it.
Trusted signed builds restore the AAR from the private
`ProdigyV21/EXTREME-TV-private-dependencies` repository through a read-only deploy
key stored as the `DISCORD_SDK_DEPLOY_KEY` repository secret.

TMDB and Trakt credentials are not committed to the repository. When a valid
Supabase config is present, app requests are routed through the tracked
`tmdb-proxy` and `trakt-proxy` Edge Functions, where those credentials should be
stored as Supabase function secrets. Forks that do not use those proxy functions
can still add their own local `TMDB_API_KEY`, `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`, and
`TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET` values in `secrets.properties` for direct local testing.

For signed release builds, copy the keystore template and fill in local signing values:

bash
cp keystore.properties.template keystore.properties

`keystore.properties` and keystore files are ignored and must stay private.

## Release Checks

Before publishing a build, run:

bash
./gradlew :app:compilePlayDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:assemblePlayRelease
./gradlew :app:assembleSideloadRelease

Smoke-test startup, profile switching, playback, stream fallback, subtitle/audio switching, IPTV/EPG loading, addon add/remove, search, settings navigation, background sync, and repeated player open/close on the supported device classes.
